# Drop Alt Layout
This is a layout for the Drop Alt.

It has a few layers:
- Base
    - `backtick` key instead of escape
    - Media controls:
        - `home` - play/pause
        - `PgUp` - volume up
        - `PgDn` - volume down
    - hold `fn` to see general modifier layer
        - activates escape and function keys
        - Media controls:
            - `right` - next track
            - `left` - prev track
        - tap `right alt` - access settings
- Coding
    - Extended space cadet shift `(, [, {`
    - Double tap to shift on some keys
    - Keys with modified behaviour accented in dull white
- Overwatch
    - Lit action keys for default controls (with the addition of Capslock used for voice communications)
    - Unused keys off
- CSGO
    - Lit action keys for my personal control setup (mostly default with some genade binds and Capslock for voice)
- Chat (supports Overwatch and CSGO text chat)
    - `Escape` activated
    - `enter` or `escape` to exit
- Settings
    - Set default layer with indicators on the number row
    - `P` to activate gradient selection
    - exit with `right alt`
    
This is all done for my personal preference, it took me a while to find an approach to doing layers for my lighting that I liked (coming from easy gradients in the bespoke Massdrop lighting system).
